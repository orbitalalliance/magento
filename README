This package allows querying of product information from Magento stores
using the SOAP API provided by Magento.

It allows querying by SKU(s) and filtering by cataegory. Limiting and
sorting are also supported. A product information filtering snippet is 
also provided that leverages the Magento product_info filtering API.

The package effectively supplies a 'getResources' snippet for Magento store
products.

Refer to the documentation in the headers of the two snippets for more
detailed information on parameters, placeholders etc.
